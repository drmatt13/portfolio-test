        title="Tiered API Access Manager"
        description="The Tiered API Access Manager is a fully automated AWS-powered system designed to manage API subscriptions and access tiers with minimal overhead. Built using the AWS SAM framework, it streamlines API key management, usage throttling, and authentication through an integrated infrastructure-as-code approach. This project deploys a scalable backend with API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and an ALB-backed Auto Scaling Group, ensuring efficient request handling and adaptive scaling. The system enforces subscription-based API access with dynamic rate limiting, automated billing, and real-time monitoring. A React-based frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing API keys and subscriptions, backed by AWS Cognito for secure authentication. By combining automation with flexibility, this solution enables businesses to monetize APIs while maintaining security, scalability, and reliability."

          title="VPC Access Control Strategies"
          description="VPC access control is crucial in securing API-driven architectures, especially when routing API Gateway traffic to a public-facing ALB. One major concern is the potential for bypassing API Gateway restrictions by directly accessing the ALB, which can expose APIs to unauthorized usage and service abuse. Various mitigation strategies exist, each with its trade-offs in complexity, cost, and security effectiveness. Removing API Gateway in favor of a custom proxy layer enhances control but adds operational overhead. Implementing mutual TLS (mTLS) at the ALB level ensures only authenticated traffic reaches the backend but introduces management complexity and scaling concerns. Alternatively, leveraging VPC Link to route API Gateway traffic directly to private VPC resources eliminates public exposure while maintaining AWS-native security mechanisms. A cost-benefit analysis reveals that while mTLS is viable for lower data transfer volumes, VPC Link offers better scalability and cost efficiency, making it the preferred solution for high-throughput architectures."

        title="Tailwind UI Design Example"
        description="Tailwind UI Design Example is a website I built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, inspired by the official Tailwind website. This project showcases my mastery of responsive UI design, emphasizing seamless transitions across all screen sizes. The site employs a heavily mobile-first approach, ensuring a flawless experience from the smallest devices to ultra-wide displays.

A key feature of this design is its use of nested layouts shared between dynamically generated routes, eliminating cumulative layout shift while streaming in only the necessary content during route changes. Breakpoint handling is executed with precision, leveraging both Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities and JavaScript-powered screen resize listeners. This ensures that UI elements like modals adapt dynamicallyâ€”automatically closing or repositioning based on whether the user is on a mobile or desktop experience. The result is a highly optimized, fluid interface that maintains visual stability while delivering a polished, intuitive experience across all devices."
